Quality Assurance (QA)

   What is QA?
    
  1.QA ensures that a product or service meets certain quality standards before it reaches the customer.
  2.It focuses on preventing problems by planning and testing during development.
  3.QA involves checking processes, writing test cases, and conducting reviews to ensure things 
    are done the right way.
  4.It's like double-checking your work to make sure itâ€™s correct and meets expectations.
  5.In software, QA tests whether the app or program works without errors and meets user needs.
  6. Proactive Approach: QA works to identify and fix issues before they happen.
  7. Focus on Processes: QA checks the methods and workflows used to create the product.
  8.Continuous Improvement: QA encourages feedback and updates to improve quality over time.

   What are the steps involved

  1. Understanding Data Requirements ( Define what data needs to be extracted and why.)
      
      Identify the source(s) of data (e.g., databases, APIs, web pages).
      Determine the format and structure of the extracted data (e.g., CSV, JSON).
      Define data quality standards (e.g., completeness, accuracy, relevance).

  2. Planning the Extraction Process  ( Outline the steps for data extraction and QA checks.)

     Choose tools and techniques for extraction (e.g., web scraping, ETL tools).
     Develop scripts or workflows for automation.
     Identify potential risks (e.g., broken data sources, incomplete records). 

  3. Data Extraction (Collect data from the source.)  

     Extract data using the planned tools or methods.
     Save data in a temporary storage location for validation.
     Handle errors (e.g., failed connections, missing fields) with logs for debugging. 

  4. Data Validation (Verify that the extracted data meets quality standards.)

     Completeness: Ensure no critical data is missing.
     Accuracy: Verify data matches the source.
     Consistency: Ensure data adheres to expected formats (e.g., date, numeric values).
     Duplication: Identify and remove duplicate entries.

  5. Error Logging and Debugging ( Identify and fix issues during the extraction process.)

     Maintain detailed logs of errors and warnings.
     Revisit the extraction logic for debugging.
     Communicate with stakeholders if source data is faulty.

  6. Transformations and Standardization (Prepare data for analysis by cleaning and standardizing it.)

    Correct formatting issues (e.g., date formats, currency symbols).
    Handle missing data (e.g., imputation, removal).
    Convert data to a uniform structure for consistency.

  7. Testing the Extracted Data (Perform detailed tests to ensure reliability.)

    Sample Testing: Manually compare samples of extracted data with the source.
    Automation Testing: Write scripts to compare large datasets with the source.
    Boundary Testing: Test edge cases like unusual formats or rare values.

  8.Documentation  (Record the data extraction and QA process for transparency and future use.)

    Document test results and any issues identified.
    Maintain a data dictionary explaining fields and formats

  9. Final Review and Approval (Ensure data meets all requirements before use.)

    Conduct a final quality review.
    Approve the data for use in analysis or reporting.

  10. Post-Extraction Monitoring (Continuously monitor extracted data for ongoing quality.)

    Set up automated checks for new data batches.
    Monitor changes in data sources that could affect extraction.


By implementing these steps, QA in data extraction ensures high-quality data, 
which is critical for reliable analysis, decision-making, and downstream processes.
