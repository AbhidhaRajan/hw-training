FINDING QA TOOL
---------------
Days back I Found Sweetviz tool,write some codes to print html report of data.
First I run the csv file with the code and got the output,
but was not suitable for json file. Then i create a code to run json file and is 
little bit difficult becz it had dictionaries. Then i fix the error.
After that i merged the codes and run the files. There exist another error that some csv file
shows some error.
Today i merged the code with fulldump code which i made to check full dump data and named it as newjc.py
and also check the code by running monthly and weekly json files.
Then i checked it with the csv file and understand the cause of error.
i fixed the error and run with so many files. got Sweetviz report as an html file.
And also got a csv file which only includes the empty columns.
