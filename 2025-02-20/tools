Checked qa tools and watch videos of Sqoop and Hive and Pig


1. Sqoop for Data QA
Sqoop is mainly used for importing and exporting structured data between Hadoop and relational databases. It helps in data QA by:

Data Consistency Checks: Ensures that data imported into Hadoop matches the original database by using validation queries.
Prevents duplicate records by importing only new or updated data.
Error Handling: Logs errors during import/export, helping to identify data inconsistencies.
Parallel Processing: Splits data into multiple chunks to reduce import/export time while maintaining accuracy.

2. Hive for Data QA
Apache Hive is a data warehouse tool that runs SQL-like queries on Hadoop. It helps in QA by:

Data Profiling: Queries can be used to check missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Schema Validation: Enforces data types and constraints using Hive tables.
Data Transformation & Standardization: Helps clean and normalize data using SQL-based queries.
