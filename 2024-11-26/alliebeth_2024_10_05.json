        "description": "As the No. 1 real estate agent in Texas, the No. 1 luxury agent in Dallas/Fort Worth, plus the 32ndtop-producing agent in the United States, Alex Perry has built his business on a solutions-based mindset.The challenges of the current market struggling to find inventory, especially homes that are priced for both a willing buyer and a willing seller have only motivated him more.Alex averaged more than $1 million in sales per day in 2021, totaling more than $375 million in volume for his best year to date and cementing his spot as the leading luxury real estate agent in the region. His goal remains the same: to find the perfect home for his clients before it hits the market, so theyre paying fair market price and not more.Being able to track down those before-market and private sales has made all the difference.If you approach everything with a solutions-based mindset, you succeed, Alex explained. There will always be problems. A strong work ethic and knowledge of the market is not a secret. Thats always been the way to succeed in this business.Notably, he sold two homes in 2021 offered at more than $20 million, including a home in Volk Estates, the prestigious University Park enclave, that set recent records for Park Cities sales.He calls his achievements a collaborative effort, noting that every successful transaction requires multiple parties, from other agents to appraisers, title companies, and the people he works with in sales and marketing at Allie Beth Allman & Associates.People and relationships are the center of my success, he said. Each year or each quarter the market could require new strategies, but creating partnerships with people to solve problems will be a constant. That strategy transcends all markets.A Southern Methodist University graduate, Alex holds a Real Estate Finance degree from the Cox School of Business. He is experienced in high-end home sales, representing both sellers and buyers, while specializing in the Park Cities, Preston Hollow and surrounding neighborhoods.In addition to his ranking as #1 in Dallas and Texas by RealTrends/The Wall Street Journal, Alex has consistently ranked as a D Best Top Producer and Best Realtor each year by D Magazine. He has been a top-producing agent with Allie Beth Allman & Associates for more than a decade.Socially, he is a big sports enthusiast. He plays golf and, as the grandson of three-time Wimbledon champion Fred Perry, he also plays tennis occasionally.",

        "description": "In 2014, Bill Stegeman pulled up stakes and joined his partner, Scott Gill, in his newly adopted state of Texas. He brought with him his full-fledged career as one of Chicagos top real estate managing brokersa career he originally cultivated in New York City. Bill immersed himself in Texas life, the landscape, and the local market, eventually launching the Astor & Longwood Residential Group with Scott. Bills honed capacity to serve his clients and advocate for them on every level, steward transactions seamlessly, andmost of allhave fun while doing it has set the Astor & Longwood apart in the industry.Centering the Client ExperienceAstor & Longwood clients point to Bills extraordinary thirty-five years experience, discretion, deep knowledge of the evolving built environment, calming presence, thorough and persistent communications, and unparalleled agility in sales negotiation as among the reasons they enjoy working with him. They appreciate his engaging and empathetic demeanor and how that combination helps make the process of buying or selling a home so much easier. His expertise in creative marketing and artful approach to social media have further differentiated Astor & Longwood from other white-glove level real estate groups in the region. A&L clients also note Bills depth of experience in private salesnot just in Texas but in the competitive markets of New York City and Chicagoas their impetus for choosing A&L.If you decide to hire Bill to sell your home, dont even consider setting expectations. No matter how high you set them, he will blow them away. Bill sold our house off-market in record time and achieved a price for us we never could have imagined when we first started the process.Astor & Longwood clients also know something about Bills dancing shoes (tried and true from his disco days at Studio 54 in NYC), endurance running and masters swimming, and green thumb. And oh yes, music: watch what can happen when Bill encounters a piano in the wild. Bill nourishes his lifelong love of music by entertaining friends with joyous Broadway show tunes in his spare hours. Bill is a member of the AIA Homes Tour House Selection Committee and, as a member of the Institute of Classical Architecture and Art, collaborates with Scott and organizes social and fundraising events for the Texas Chapter.Bill holds an MBA in real estate finance from Columbia University and a bachelors degree from Princeton University, as well as certificates in interior design from the New York School of Interior Design and graphic design from Harvard University.We never once doubted that Bill would go to bat for us on any issue that arose nor that he would lose. His negotiation skills are truly something to behold, particularly the way he delivers articulate, fact-based positions in a personable, but firm manner that are nearly impossible for the other side to refute. Another agent might not enjoy going up against Bill, but theyll still like him when its all over.",

Her market knowledge and determination stem from a true love of real estate and helping people. By exceeding client expectations, Brittani has built her real estate career through her relationships with her clients and their referrals of family and friends. Nothing speaks more highly than gaining the loyalty and trust of those she helps.Being involved in real estate from a very young age with parents and grandparents who were Realtors and builder-developers, its what Brittani understands and does best. Today, as a homeowner and property investor, she knows first-hand what it takes to find, negotiate, and sell properties for her clients. Naturally, Brittani's persistence and dedication to her clients' best interest is evident by the number of satisfied clients who count on her expertise and hard work. With strong attention to detail, communication, marketing and problem solving, you won't find anyone who is more dedicated to helping you with your home or investment property.When she's not in the office or with clients, Brittani enjoys time with her husband, sons, daughter, and Goldendoodle.

We were very lucky to get connected with her. Even though we had done a lot of research early on, she helped us out so much. She provided us with great detail about the Dallas market and added several additional properties for us to consider. She ultimately was able to find us a unit that wasn't even on the market yet (our purchase)! She is very knowledgeable, professional and responsive; a top-notch transaction advisor. We would definitely work with her again and will recommend her to our friends.- Mike MerrittI thoroughly enjoyed working with Brittani. She was attentive to my needs and did a good job at pointing me towards properties that met my criteria. Additionally, she was extremely helpful during the offer, negotiation and closing processes. I highly recommended Brittani and would definitely utilize her services for sale or purchase of my next home.- Adrian WatsonBrittani is amazing at her craft. Not only is she courteous and polite, but she is very professional and has a great understanding of market conditions. You definitely feel confident in her representation!- Devin GonzalezWe couldnt be happier with our experience with Brittani. We moved long distance with 3 kids and I was very nervous about finding a house that was a good fit for our family. Brittani was very responsive and supportive throughout the process and made our home search feel seamless. Thanks, Brittani!- The Brown FamilyI initially worked with Brittani as a buyer, and without hesitation she was my first and only call when I was ready to sell. Brittani is an exceptional Realtor, extremely knowledgeable, great to work with and also a truly great person. Her guidance was invaluable...from an eye for interior decorating (and literally helping lift and rearrange furniture) to ensuring every detail is in order to ensure a smooth process (on both sides of the transaction). I highly recommend Brittani to anyone looking to buy or sell and cannot thank her enough for all her help. - Greg Hill",

He says he enjoys the fact that real estate is so topical and routinely comes up in discussions beyond the workplace. Its an important element in any community fabric being an expert in real estate makes me better connected to my community and provides a continual incentive for me to help others.Chriss methodology for success is simple: For me, it's a full-time, seven-day-a-week process. From the time I awaken to late hours, Im focused on all my current transactions and listings, as well as prospects. His schedule varies daily, even on an hourly basis, depending on the clients needs. One of my trade secrets is that Im a chronic list-maker, which keeps me accountable throughout the day, he smiles. He credits a devotion to consistent availability and dependability as the keys to his professionalism. Im resourceful and will find solutions to any issue real estate related, he addsThe Park Cities and surrounding areas, Preston Hollow, Lakewood/East Dallas, Uptown/Downtown are all areas Chris knows intimately. Live where you work, as I like to say, he explains. I also enjoy working with an even mix of buyers and sellers since I have significant expertise on both sides of the transaction.As far as specific real estate superpowers, Chris has substantial skills as a successful negotiator, which is at the top of his list. Due to years of marketing experience, I have a clear understanding of what it takes to bring a home to market and maximize an owners exposure, he says. Understanding all areas of Dallas and its distinctive regionalism is key when it comes to guiding buyers through such an important life decision. I also have a successful track record of handling stressful situations in a calm, productive fashion, which is a valuable service to my clients, says Chris.As a senior vice president at Allie Beth Allman & Associates, Chris founded The Haven Group in 2007, which he successfully ran for many years. Then, on September 8, 2021, Chris and longtime Haven colleague Ashley Rasmussen took a bold new step when they formed The Rasmussen + Pyle Real Estate Group. He says the pair had discussed building the partnership over several years. But when they finally made it official, It just made good sense.Our new team is a partnership in which both of our names are prominent. In my two decades in real estate, it marks the first time to put my name on a brand. And I am proud to do this with Ashley. He points to the pairs similar styles, particularly when it comes to thoughtfully guiding buyers to the right decision. Whether that is advertising, data analysis, or savvy marketing, in the process of the transaction or listing, our mission is to always put the client first, Chris explains. For Ashley and me, were not interested in growing beyond our bandwidth. Were dedicated to making sure we are personally handling all our clients, an attention to detail that is a defining hallmark of The Rasmussen + Pyle Real Estate Group.Geographic proximity is another important element for the team: I live in Preston Hollow, and Ashleys in the Park Cities, thus we cover a lot of ground in terms of direct product knowledge.",

Excellence then is not an act, but a habit. -AristotleAs a senior executive vice president in the only Berkshire Hathaway affiliate in Texas, Allie Beth Allman & Associates, Frank Purcell has been described as playing an important role in the real estate markets he serves. Celebrating over 20 award winning years in residential real sales, Frank continues to bring energy, enthusiasm and innovation to the sales experience for both Buyers and Sellers. Extensive internet, video, print and media advertising have become an integral part of his sales approach for all of his clients. Frank and his wife, Jane have been Park Cities residents for the last 30 years and have two children.Why My Clients Come BackI know there are many choices for Buyers and Sellers when choosing an agent. I am always so pleased when someone hires me to represent them and I do my best to insure that their expectations are not only met, but exceeded.The majority of Frank's sales are repeat clients and referrals. He considers it the highest compliment when a past client endorses him to their friends and family. He is now helping second generations of clients whom he served over the years. Clients can count on him to follow through with every detail of the transaction.The Secret of My SuccessThe secret to Frank's success is honesty, persistence, perseverance, loyal friends and a loving family. Another element of Frank's success has been the consistent mentoring Frank received from Allie Beth Allman, especially in the early years as he was building his residential real estate business. Now, after 20 years in the business, it is one of Frank's great pleasure to mentor newer Allie Beth Allman agents and see them going on to attain great success their real estate sales.Extras I Provide My ClientsIt may sound simple, but what I provide that not every agent offers is personal representation. When a client hires me, they can be confident that they'll receive my attention and my time. I will be there for the negotiating, the strategizing, and the closing. After all, that is what they hired me for.

Situations that initially seemed like the worst possible outcomes almost always turned out to be far from it.A few years ago, a birthday lunch and a long conversation with a very close friend led to my current role in real estate. I didnt go to lunch that day with a new adventure in mind, but I left with a renewed sense of purpose and excitement, deciding to build on my long career in salesthis time in the world of actual bricks-and-mortar instead of fashion.As a young woman, sheer luck brought me to an entry-level job in retail, where my inquisitive and determined spirit helped me advance through the ranks at Dallas beloved Neiman Marcus. I managed several full-line stores, led the start-up of NeimanMarcus.com, and eventually ran the 28-store Last Call division. Inspired by many mentors over the years, I developed a true entrepreneurial spirit within a very large and successful company.My time in real estate has allowed me to build on that foundation and continue doing what I really love: connecting with people. Building a network, paying attention to detail, and finding positive outcomes for clients keeps me going every day.I have served on the boards of numerous non-profit and professional organizations, as well as on the Board of my HOA. I've also been involved in many charitable fundraising projects and have been a featured speaker at several retail symposiums and university lecture series. I am a proud 7th-generation Texan.While at Neiman Marcus, I met my wonderful husband Roger when he called on me to sell advertising. He got the sale, and I got him.",

        "description": "I believe a realtor provides guidance, expertise and calm during what is often the most important purchase in your life. You really want someone who feels like a friend, a protector, marketer, negotiator and collaborator. After spending twenty plus years as a broadcast anchor/reporter and owning my own interior design firm, I am proud to have earned my real estate license. I am a new agent who brings enthusiasm to the market along with my well-honed skills as a communicator, storyteller, renovator and designer. Im especially humbled to work with Allie Beth Allman and Associates and with Susan Baldwin of the Baldwin Group, a longtime top producing team. I bring to the team a fierce loyalty to our clients; the willingness to work hard; and the energy to find solutions when met with unique obstacles.As a longtime real estate investor in Dallas, I have extensive knowledge of the Dallas market having lived in Lake Highlands, Highland Park, Bluffview and University Park. Given my zip code history, I feel very connected to how emotional and exciting the search for the perfect home and neighborhood can be; I also know first hand the challenges of getting a home ready for sale. However, my family has always had an ally to help us conquer any real estate obstacle: a good realtor.Clearly, my family and I are not afraid of the moving process, but that doesnt mean we havent experienced the stress and strain that can go along with buying and selling a home. One noted move was during the sweltering month of August while I was nine months pregnant and had a toddler and three dogs in tow. It seemed impossible, but with the help of our realtor, we made it work. We were also met with unique challenges while holding three properties during the housing market crash in 2008. Through good advice and faith that the market would rebound, we were able to profit through leasing and holding onto our investments. Historically, real estate has always brought my family financial security and assurance. I never tire of searching for the perfect home and making a space our own.In addition to my love of house hunting and negotiating, I also thrive on deadlines and have a proven track record of finding calm and clarity during chaos. I love meeting new people and discovering their stories. Plus, I firmly believe that buying or selling a home can be a wonderful experience and an absolute joy. I would be honored to help you create your favorite story in your next home.Heather Behrens is a Texan by choice and a native of Oklahoma where she attended the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma and received a bachelor of arts degree in communication.

It sets the tone for the quality of your daily life and is the setting that influences most of your activities and memories together as a family. Its also your greatest ongoing financial expense and it is often the greatest financial investment of your lifetime. The search for a house is a process. It requires defining, assessing and reaching consensus on many family objectives and then determining what property meets those objectives both physically and financially. Facilitating that discussion and guiding a family through the myriad of alternatives is what I enjoy most. Those options include:Understanding education alternatives and their associated costsTravel and commute implications for work and schoolPreference for a city vs rural environmentProximity to extracurricular activities such as sporting events, arts and churchTaxation and zoning variancesHow these concerns are met and the cost of meeting them is often a struggle. Jeanne has lived in the metroplex for over 30 years covering Dallas to Fort Worth in corporate service and in residential real estate. While she concentrates predominately in Park Cities and Preston Hollow, Jeanne has clients throughout the metroplex that she serves.Jeanne was a major account major for Xerox Corporation for fourteen years covering much of North Texas before transitioning into residential real estate. Having been a licensed realtor since 1994, Jeanne has seen the ups and downs of the markets within the metroplex.

This was our first home purchase and we were moving from out of state so there were many additional details and complications, but Laura was on top of everything and incredibly helpful in answering our many questions. We would highly recommend working with Laura.My husband and I relocated to Dallas recently for work and were referred to Laura through my employer. We tried to prepare ourselves for home buying by reading books and following listings online, but Lauras step-by-step guidance through the fast-paced days of negotiations, inspections, and contract amendments was critically important. From contract to closing, Laura was incredibly proactive toward resolving uncertainties and ambiguities with commitments in writing so that our actual closing had no drama whatsoever. We wholeheartedly recommend Laura.",

Her background in teaching provides her with the skills necessary to build meaningful relationships based on dedication, communication, and trust. Her organizational skills, attention to detail, and high standard of professionalism all ensure her clients receive the best care possible.Mary truly believes the most important part of this business is building lasting relationships with her clients.

        "description": "Mike Bates is a real estate agent at Allie Beth Allman & Associates in Dallas.Hes what some might refer to as a classic renaissance man, an archetypal entrepreneur with a long string of business successes. And when it comes to real estate agents, that can a very good person to know. To understand Mikes present, its important to recognize his past. He is from Abilene, a Texan by birth with a distinctive professional background.Ive been called a turn around guy by clients and the guy who gets it done, he explains. Usually while others are staring at their phones,he adds with a laugh. It is that kind of determination thats made Mike an indispensable resource for his clients. Educated in Texas, Mike graduated the University of North Texas with a double major in General Business and Hospitality Management.I began working in my familys small manufacturing business as a machine operator before I could even drive.Together he and his dad would join forces to build Mikes very first car, which, as it turned out, was the beginning of a lifelong fascination.Over the years, I have owned more than 300 cars,he says.I have five or 10 at any given time that Im working on. In fact, I paid for my education working in hospitality and selling the cars that I rebuilt.While attending college, he also started buying and selling condos in Dallass Uptown district where he did basic work while living in the renovation projects. Mikes life took a turn in 2004 when a realtor failed to show for a routine closing. As a result, he got his own license and promptly generated $4 million in sales through his first 9 months in the business. With his family, Mike purchased an assisted living facility, Serenity Estates located west of Fort Worth in Mineral Wells. It was renovated, opened in 2014, and still operates to this day.The diverse qualities of Mikes career provide for numerous strengths as a real estate agent. His experience as a general contractor, a deep understanding of the mechanics of homes, and direct access to skilled repair and craftspeople, plus an eye for detail, and knowledge about senior living issues provide tangible advantages to clients. He wakes up every morning determined to serve, which, he says, often means assisting with maintenance challenges and property issues that arise long after the sale.I strive to take the stress out of owning property by consulting wisely on what best fits my clients and makes the most of their return on investments.He joined Allie Beth Allman & Associates Real Estate in November of 2021because he wanted to be a part of a quality team, one that enjoys the admiration of clients as well as competitors, recognized as the areas premier brokerage.Mike has lived in Oak Cliff with his husband, Ryan,of 23 years since 2005, way before it was cool, he chuckles. However, he works everywhere in Dallas-Fort Worth (as well as in Parker and Palo Pinto Counties), proud of the brand hes carefully cultivated over the years, focused on experience, unique insights, and a sincere dedication to top-notch service.When youcallme, yougetme not an assistant,he explains.Over the years Mike has consistently been recognized for his work, honored time and again by D Best, Advocate Best, and others, as well as a top producer at competing firms prior to joining Allie Beth Allman & Associates. A concerned community advocate, he volunteers his time to organizations including North Texas Scottie Rescue, serving on their Board of Directors since 2016.",

Raul ranked among the firms top three producers twice and was Stapps number one producer in 2020.Making the move to Allie Beth Allman & Associates was logical, he says, pointing to the companys well-established strength in local zip codes where hes experienced solid business growth. Raul describes himself as data-driven, someone who spends a significant volume of time gathering statistics on each neighborhood to clearly understand agents, builders, and the market.During his career, he has also been an exclusive investor in new luxury homes in some of the hottest neighborhoods in Dallas.

Raul first came to Texas in 2005 to attend Southern Methodist University. He graduated with majors in Advertising as well as Markets & Culture. Rauls college experience in the heart of the Park Cities helped him establish close personal and professional connections in the local market where hes worked since finishing college.Always an avid learner, Raul takes pride in constantly honing his business skills. He closely follows consumer trends and buying-habits, all designed to assist his clients, and is fluent in English and Spanish, a bonus for international clients.Going the extra mile is an important trademark, something he brings to his clients, who have described his work as beyond the call of duty, first-class all the way, and an incredible asset. Rauls critical eye, as described by a recent buyer, and an intimate understanding of the building process, materials, and the costs involved, he believes is rare and an invaluable asset for his clients.

They then use their experience and understanding of the current real estate market to help the clients achieve their goals. The best realtors also know that even the smoothest real estate transactions can be stressful and help prepare their clients to face any challenges with informed confidence.I honed my listening skills (and learned the perils of communication failures) as a flight attendant recruiter, instructor and supervisor at American Airlines. After the birth of my sons, I became a special education teacher with HPISD, where I learned to help people through uniquely challenging situations every day. More recently, I used my listening skills as the Women's Council of Realtor's Dallas Network as their 2017 President by actively listening to the needs of Realtor and Affiliate members and creating educational programs to meet those needs.I look forward to putting these experiences and skillsand my knowledge of the Dallas real estate marketto work for you to help you reach your real estate goals.",

        "description": "The customer care and commitment begins with hello, and it never ends. Thats the level of service and dedication that Sada Millican has provided North Texas home buyers and sellers for over 25 years.I become very attached to the people that I have the opportunity of bringing together with the right home,says Sada, who has lived and been involved in the Dallas community for over 40 years.Years ago I drove past a darling Tudor home in the M Streets that I sold a young couple, and sitting in front was an empty baby stroller box. I just had to stop and get the family news.The past customers were delighted to inform Sada that their first child was due the following week. Two more children later, Sada has since sold that home and helped them in the purchase of another home for their growing family.There are so many stories like that that are the true testament to the high quality of service, expertise and long-term commitment that Sada offers. Generations of relocating families and individuals have trusted her with the purchase or sale of their most important investment, their home.Beyond the personal touch, Sada Millican brings to her customers a broad knowledge of numerous communities in the Metroplex. Formerly a legal assistant to a real estate attorney, she melds her marketing and sales skills with a meticulous attention to deliver the best results in the shortest time possible.Knowing so many neighborhoods, I am able to help my home buyers quickly zero in on the areas that best fit their budget and needs, explains Sada. This also helps me to target market the listings I represent to the most likely candidates for a property and its lifestyle.An active volunteer in the community, Sada Millican and her husband of over 40 years raised their grown sons in the Dallas area. Her roots are equally deep in the real estate community where she has established a network with her colleagues and a strong reputation for integrity and drive.I am dedicated to being an efficient, effective and professional businesswoman, says Sada Millican. Allie Beth Allman & Associates is a firm that stands above all of the others in providing an environment that empowers excellence in all that we do for our customers.",

        "description": "Scott Gills real estate career is a rare one that is intertwined with his passionate study of architecture and design. His acumen for detail and ability to anticipate and navigate the intricacies of construction, renovation, resales, and co-op boards eventually led him to managing broker positions for three major Chicago firms. In 2012, Scott took a sabbatical from his career in Chicago to pursue a PhD in architectural history at UT Austin, embracing the big Texas sky with his partner, Bill Stegeman. Today, Dr. Gill, co-author of three books on the architecture of his former home state of Kentucky, brings Astor & Longwood clients his thirty-five years of experience in real estate sales and management, a boundless curiosity for the built environment, and his keen eye for the design and architectural values and possibilities others tend to overlook.Centering the Client ExperiencePrompt, optimistic, thorough, collaborative: these are some of the ways Astor & Longwood clients describe Scott. Insatiably inquisitive about houses, condos, and developments, Scott often discovers the gems first. His years of real estate sales and management experience in Chicago, combined with his architectural and construction knowledge and experience on condo and coop boards, provide A&L clients with the ability to make decisions with confidence. Scott has an uncanny ability to see how certain design and architectural choices and elements will be a source of meaningful pleasure in his clients lives and a boon to their property value. He can glance at a floorplan and describe what works and what could work better. He understands the client experience is a psychological one and moves with pace and empathy according to his clients goals.A class act! Scott guided us through the homebuying process with all the skill and precision youd expect of someone with nearly four decades of real estate experience.Like Bill, Scott recalls his disco days at Studio 54 with fondness. He delights in hiking, exploring, and getting in the car, pointing in a direction, and heading out for adventure. Scott is a director of the Texas Chapter of the Institute of Classical Architecture and Art, a current member and past director of the Society of Architectural Historians, and an Associate Member of the AIA. And for the architecturally curious, his award-winning books,Kentucky Houses of Stratton Hammon, Country Houses of Louisville,1899-1939, andGideon Shryock: His Life and Architecture, 1802-1880, are available to order through your independent bookseller or on Amazon.Scott holds a PhD in architectural history from UT Austin, an MBA from MIT, a master of architecture degree from Rice University, and a bachelor of arts in history from Stanford University.The care Scott took to make sure our real estate needs were met was remarkable. And Im not just talking about helping us secure a home we loved. More than this, he communicated with expertise why the first several homes we looked at werent right. That PhD in Architectural History sure comes in handy when looking for a house!",

        "description": "While a business student at The University of Texas in Austin, Simone made a career decision that has stayed with her for 40 years. She decided to go into real estate. After a BBA in marketing and a minor in real estate, Simone returned to Dallas. A native Dallasite, Simone has been married since 1986 to Wes Jeanes. She has two grown daughters who attended Dallas' private schools. Her oldest daughter is an attorney with Vinson & Elkins in Dallas, and her youngest has joined her in the real estate business as a licensed assistant.Simone has consistently been in the top 5 producers of the Brokerage companies she has associated with. Prior to joining Allie Beth Allman, she was the top producer for 3 of the last 4 years at a company with 350 agents. Her first year at Allie Beth Allman in 2019, she ranked #5 among the extremely successful individual producers.Having lived through the many cycles of real estate, including when interest rates were 18.5%, Simone believes the experiences of having so many transactions has given her the knowledge to respond.Simone has been assisting relocation clients for over 25 years with Marriott as a large client. Through the years she has assisted people at Southern-Glazers, Nike, Coca-Cola, and many others. Additionally, she has continued to represent friends, family & notable Dallas families.If a client, can reflect on their real estate transaction that I handled and state that I exemplified integrity and character, along with knowledge and professionalism, I am gratified. That is what keeps me motivated.In her spare time, Simone enjoys dining-out, cooking, any activity around horses or dogs, travel, arts & theatre.",

        "description": "Driven by a passion for helping people buy and sell homes, Sunny Wood combines unparalleled local expertise with exceptional client service to produce extraordinary results. After moving to Dallas from the East Coast with her husband, Sunny Wood quickly established herself as one of the foremost real estate agents in the region, consistently recognized as a top producer in D Magazine, Neighborhood Advocate, and Texas Monthly. By leveraging her experience, persistence, and can-do positive attitude against some of the toughest economic cycles in Texas history, Sunny continues to raise the bar.Asking the right questions and listening to clients' wants and needs have helped Sunny accomplish several benchmarks in her storied career. In the late 90's she was tasked to assist with one of Dallas' first Intown Housing initiatives - the acquisition and development of four historic buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which were transformed into 200 residential lofts. These old factories were vacant and in disrepair. The city of Dallas offered funds to developers to save these buildings from the wrecking ball and turn them into living spaces. Now, the downtown area boasts several thousand residential units and a world class Arts District, and the streets are bustling with activity. I am proud to be part of that transition, says Sunny.A 40-year resident of Dallas, Sunny also enjoys focusing her sales and marketing efforts on the neighborhoods where she and her husband have put down their own roots. Together they raised their two daughters in Lakewood and Lake Highlands, and were actively involved in Booker T Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts,Now living near the Park Cities, Sunny has expanded her business to include University Park, Highland Park, Preston Hollow, Devonshire, Greenway Parks, Uptown/Downtown Dallas, Richardson, Plano, Farmers Branch, Coppell, Frisco, Southlake, and beyond. Her experience in buying and selling homes spans from every corner of Dallas and deep into Texas Hill Country.Sunny is a graduate of the University of Maryland and a member of the Greater Dallas, Texas and National Association of Realtors. She frequently participates in professional development programs to stay current in the marketplace and has earned her Accredited Luxury Home Specialist Designation as well as her Accredited Buyers Representative designations. Sunny has established a loyal following of repeat clients and referrals which keep her focused on what matters most-relationships.Sunny was the best agent I have ever worked with and my husband and I have bought many homes over the last 25 years, said Nancy, a repeat client. Her sense of loyalty to us was impeccable, explained clients Daniel and Sammy. Not only did she help us look at properties, she was at our beck and call until our home was found, and she was there until all inspections were passed, offers were agreed upon, and happiness/ownership was signed sealed and delivered. She will always be the first person we suggest to our friends and family.From real estate sales and leasing, to high-end developments and property management in virtually every Dallas community, Sunny has the knowledge and business savvy to get the job done. If you are in the market for an accomplished professional to sell your property in record time at the highest possible price, or, looking for an expert to guide you to the perfect Dallas neighborhood, give Sunny a call.",

        "description": "There's just something about her! To get the inside scoop on real estate legend Terri Cox, it would take a reporter all day and night. Fortunately, her clients and colleagues were able to share plenty of insights on this one-of-a-kind professional.Reaching the pinnacle of success as the No. 2 individual producer in 2016 at Allie Beth Allman & Associates, the market leader in luxury real estate, illustrates perfectly the can-do winning attitude that radiates from Cox. Here's how others describe her: contagious, committed, courageous, and client-centered with clear business acumen. She really knows real estate. She cares, and it shows.Cox began her career in commercial real estate and property management in 1985, moving to residential sales at Ellen Terry, REALTORS in 1995. In her first year, Cox sold millions of dollars in real estate and was awarded the Rookie of the Year Spirit Award. She was also Ellen Terry's first recipient of the highly regarded Service with a Heart Award. In 2007, she joined Allie Beth Allman & Associates where she is an executive vice president, a position earned through leadership and achieving consistent high sales volume. Her career continues to soar.What is it about her? Charisma? A sixth sense? It's much more than that. Cox is an authentic individual who is in a unique place to empathize with her clients' real life experiences. Widowed at a young age and the now-single parent of a dynamic 16-year-old, courage and commitment stand out among the best of her character qualities. She meets life and business head on with courageous perseverance, maintaining a fully orchestrated, high-performance scheduleup at 5 a.m. (no kidding), committed all day long to helping her clients achieve their real estate dreams.Whether you're going modern in Preston Hollow, living the unhurried Lakewood lifestyle, or gaining space for a growing family in the Park Cities, Terri Patrick Cox is the consummate real estate pro. After hearing Cox's story, it's not surprising that she is one of this year's top producers (D Magazine July 2011 Issue).Specialization:Park Cities, Preston Hollow, LakewoodDesignations, Affiliations & Awards:Senior Vice President, Allie Beth Allman & Associates; No. 2 Individual Producer 2014, Allie Beth Allman & Associates; D Magazine Top Producer, Accredited Buyer Representative; Historic Home Specialist; Women's Auxiliary to Children's Medical Center (Lifetime Member); The Partnership (Founding Member); Chi Omega Alumn",

If you seek architecturally inspired service with a global reach, give Tom Amis a call.I just wanted to let you know how pleased we were with Buff and Tom Amis, who recently helped us sell our house in Caruth Court.Their insight into the market was invaluable, which allowed us to price the property precisely, (and profitably) and get it sold in two days!I think that Buffs experience in interior design enables potential buyers to see clearly the possibilities of a new home, as does Toms training as an architect.Beyond that, Buff and Tom were helpful, friendly, not pushy, and exactly what we wanted and needed to get us through this transaction.I would recommend them without reservation to anyone who is thinking about buying or selling a home in the Dallas area.Over the years we have bought and sold a number of homes and have used Buff for our last two transactions.Victor G.Bloede, Jr.Buff and Tom Amis made the purchase of our home actually fun and exciting! They helped us every step of the way - giving us referrals for many of the items we wanted to change or needed to address. We also did a renovation and used a suggestion that Tom had made during a walk through. His expertise and experience as architect were perfect. Even after our closing, they continued to help - their follow-through was beyond expectation. They got us in our perfect home and we highly recommend them.William and Sandra FeganWhen I listen to my friends and colleagues discuss their unfortunate real estate deals, I almost feel guilty! You handled both of our recent transactions beautifully. Thank you for your attention to detail, willingness to answer our unending questions with patience, and superb negotiating skills.From our initial meeting to discuss listing our home, we knew that we had made the right decision in choosing you to represent us. Your suggestions and advice throughout the sale of our home were right on target. When we described our dream home, you far exceeded our expectations in locating the ideal new home for us. You have the gift of being assertive whennecessary, yetremaining pleasant and kind at all times. We appreciate your high ethical standards and excellent communication skills. Thank you for removing the stress that typically accompanies the sale and purchase of a new home.Greg Farnsworth",

        "description": "To know Dallas is to love Dallas and all of the wonderful micro neighborhoods and excellent suburbs within and around this fabulous city. Matching people with the best home and location for them is a passion for me and I look forward to it every day. Primarily specializing in University Park, Highland Park, Southlake, Westlake, North Dallas, Preston Hollow, Devonshire, Bluffview, Lakewood, Uptown, the gorgeous Dallas High Rises and the newer developments in the areas of Plano, Frisco, McKinney & Parker all depending on what my clients need and prefer. These areas represent some of the most recognized neighborhoods, school districts and suburbs in the metroplex and present a diverse array of life styles and opportunities in order to meet your real estate goals be it schools, price point, style, location, or investment strategy. Working with buyers, sellers, investors and relocation and speaking both English and Spanish allows me to often represent people through generations even as their children find a need for college housing, a new home after graduation, homes for employees as they transfer to Dallas and as they downsize and upsize in life. A home is everything. Life happens in a home. It's where hopes and dreams are born. My strong team of several agents and coordinators has a keen ability to coordinate all of the details of todays sophisticated buying transactions from finding that perfect home, negotiating the transaction, arranging the financing, inspecting the property and successfully closing to selling including the staging, pricing and marketing in order to get the best price in the least amount of time. Strong, personal relationships with other REALTORS, Luxury Portfolio International and the excellent knowledge of the Metroplex expands available real estate offerings through powerful local and global resources to give you the best options and choices.Background: I have been representing buyers and sellers of real estate since college days while I earned a BS in Environmental Biology and Chemistry. As it turns out, real estate has always been my passion. I do have three accomplished daughters: the oldest is an attorney practicing locally, another is a pharmacist and the youngest is a marketing executive with an international firm. Speaking Spanish has allowed us to live in several other countries as my children grew up and helps me when representing clients from Mexico, South America and Europe. I strongly believe in giving back to my community and volunteer at Equest for rehabilitative horsemanship as well as supporting the American Lung Association, Communities in Schools and The Salvation Army.I want to work for you and am always available for you.",
