1. Pandas profiling

       Pandas is a very vast library that offers many functions with the help of which we can understand 
  our data. Pandas profiling provides a solution to this by generating comprehensive reports for 
  datasets that have numerous features.These reports can be customized according to specific 
  requirements.

       Pandas Profiling is a powerful library in Python that automates the process of performing 
   exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a pandas DataFrame. It generates an interactive,
   comprehensive, and detailed report on the dataset, which helps you quickly understand 
   its structure, patterns, and potential issues.


   Key Features of Pandas Profiling:


   Summary Statistics: It generates a wide range of summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation,
                       min/max values, and more for each column in your dataset.

   Data Distribution: Provides histograms, bar charts, and other visualizations to show the distribution 
                    of numerical and categorical data.

   Missing Values Analysis: Identifies columns with missing or incomplete data, allowing you to easily 
                           spot and handle such issues.
   Outlier Detection: Highlights potential outliers using statistical methods, enabling you to decide how 
                     to handle them.
