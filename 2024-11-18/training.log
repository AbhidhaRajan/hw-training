Regex for QA Tasks


  Regular Expressions (Regex) are incredibly useful for Quality Assurance (QA), especially 
  in tasks that involve validating, searching, or extracting specific patterns from text data.
  Regex is used to ensure data consistency, identify anomalies, and validate formats.
  The re module in Python provides support for working with regular expressions.
  

  Characters used for matching:

   a) ^ and $:

        ^ ensures that the string starts with the pattern.
        $ ensures the string ends with the pattern.
     Together, these guarantee the entire string matches the pattern.

   b) [abc] :  a,b or c .

   c) [^abc] : any character except a,b,c .

   d) [a-z] : a to z. 
   
   e) [A-Z] : A to Z.

   f) [a-z A-Z] : a to z,A to Z .

   g) [0-9] : 0 to 9 .

   h) [ ]? : occurs 0 or 1 time
   
   i) [  ]+ : occurs 1 or more times.

   j) [  ]* : occurs 0 or more times.

   k) [  ]{n} : occurs n times.

   l) [  ]{n,} : occurs n or more times.

   m) \ d  : [0-9]
   n) \ D  :[^0-9]
   o) \w   :[a-zA-Z_0-9]
   p)\W    :[^\w]

        

Key Functions in the re Module

   1. re.match()  : Matches the pattern at the beginning of the string.

   2. re.search() : Searches the entire string for the first match of the pattern.

   3.re.findall() : Returns a list of all non-overlapping matches in the string.

   4. re.sub()    : Substitutes occurrences of the pattern with a replacement string.

   5.re.split()   : Splits the string by occurrences of the pattern.

   6.re.fullmatch() : Ensures the entire string matches the pattern.


  
  
Some common regex patterns and their QA use cases:

  1. Email Validation
         Used for Verify that the email addresses is valid or not

  2. Phone Number Validation
        Check that the phone numbers are valid by using patterns.

  3. URL Validation

       Validate if a string is a correctly formatted URL.
  4. Date Validation
       
       Verify dates in MM/DD/YYYY format or in any other formats.
  5. Detect Missing/Empty Values

      Identify empty or null fields in datasets.
  6. Validate Numbers

     Ensure numeric fields contain valid numbers with valid datatype.

  7. Check for Duplicates

     Identify duplicate lines or entries in a text or in the file.

  8. Remove/Identify Special Characters

     Clean data by removing unwanted special characters.
  9. Validate Alphanumeric Codes

     Ensure product codes or IDs follow the required format.
  10.Validate Currency Formats

      Ensure monetary values are properly formatted.
