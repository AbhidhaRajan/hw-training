File Handling: 
--------------
Prompts the user to input the path to a CSV or JSON file and validates its existence.

Data Processing:
----------------

Reads CSV files with automatic delimiter detection (, or |)

Handles JSON files, ensuring that empty lists and dictionaries are treated as missing values.

Report Generation:
------------------

Identifies unique values in each column of the dataset.

If a URL column (e.g., 'pdp_url') is present, it associates each unique value with its corresponding URL.

Generates an interactive HTML report where clicking on a field name reveals its unique values and associated URLs

Exploratory Data Analysis
-------------------------

Utilizes the sweetviz library to create a comprehensive analysis report of the dataset.

After processing, the script will generate two reports in the current directory:

qa_unique_values_with_urls_report.html:
--------------------------------------
 An interactive HTML report displaying unique values for each column with associated URLs.

sweetviz_report.html:
---------------------
 A comprehensive analysis report generated by the sweetviz library.

Open these HTML files in a web browser to explore the reports.
